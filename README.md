## Description

My motivation to build this project was to create an application so somebody can easily track their ecommerce business by utilizing a database. The project is built using sequelize in node.js. With this app you can easily view, add, update or delete any category, product or tag in your database. This project taught me how to utilize the sequelize package when building a database. 

## Installation

To install this application you will need to download virtual studio code or another code editor, setup your ssh keys, and copy the git repo into your local machine.

## Usage

After you copy the repo into your machine, you will want to make sure you have node.js downloaded and installed as well. After that you open your integrated terminal in your code editor and run npm run start to run the application. Below is a video example:
